    <h1>Shanvanth's Last Stand</h1>
    <p>Official Game Manual</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>I must admit, I used a clanker for this because I was lazy. BUT, I wrote the readme manual myself. I just needed it reformatted in HTML. If you want my original manual, <a href = "https://github.com/Imeanbusiness/Shan-s-Last-Stand">here</a> it is, on the game's GitHub.</p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <h3>Minimum Specs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GT 730</li>
      <li>CPU: Intel Core i3-4130</li>
      <li>RAM: 4GB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It'll run <em>OKAY</em>, a little choppy but still playable.</p>

    <h3>Recommended Specs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce MX 110</li>
      <li>CPU: Intel Core i5-4460</li>
      <li>RAM: 8GB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pretty consistent 60fps, hopefully.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <h3>Player HUD</h3>
    <img src="HudPicture.png" alt="Interface">
    <p>Each HUD element provides key gameplay info:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>HP</strong> – Your health. Replenish with Shaunulators.</li>
      <li><strong>Weapon</strong> – Shows current weapon. Switch with <strong>1–3</strong> or <strong>c</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Ammo</strong> – Sanity cost per weapon; manage it wisely.</li>
      <li><strong>Shanvanth Image</strong> – Reflects sanity (insane → normal → happy).</li>
      <li><strong>Sanity</strong> – Affects damage and fire ability.</li>
      <li><strong>Wave</strong> – Increases every 2500 score; enemies toughen.</li>
      <li><strong>Score</strong> – Points or XP; higher is better.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Use <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to move, <strong>Shift</strong> to dash, and your <strong>mouse</strong> to aim. Press <strong>Space</strong> or <strong>Click</strong> to attack.</p>
    <img src="AttackingRead.png" alt="Attacking">

    <p>Different weapons have unique damage values. Switch weapons using <strong>number keys</strong> or <strong>C</strong> for the Mechanical Pencil. Avoid enemy hits and projectiles—once HP hits 0, it’s over.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Weapons</h2>

  <p><em>All stats assume you are in "Derivatives are doable..." difficulty, the normal difficulty, at level 1 with 50% sanity.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hotkey:</strong> Button to switch to weapon.</li>
    <li><strong>Sanity Usage:</strong> How much sanity the weapon uses up per shot.</li>
    <li><strong>Base Damage:</strong> The regular amount of damage the weapon would deal with no modifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Ready Time:</strong> How long the weapon takes to ready when you first switch to it (in ms).</li>
    <li><strong>Weapon Fire Rate:</strong> How many times per minute (RPM) the weapon can be fired.</li>
    <li><strong>Base DPS:</strong> Damage per second with no modifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> A rough idea of the weapon’s range.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mechanical Pencil</h3>
  <img src="MCPencil.png" alt="Mechanical Pencil">
  <ul>
    <li>Hotkey: <strong>C</strong></li>
    <li>Sanity Usage: N/A</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 475</li>
    <li>Weapon Ready Time: 250 ms</li>
    <li>Weapon Fire Rate: 200 RPM (3.33 RPS)</li>
    <li>Base DPS: 1550</li>
    <li>Range: Melee</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Shanvanth's favourite pencil can be used to do calculus on anything, even people! This keeps him sane, so he always keeps the pencil on him. This weapon is a <strong>melee</strong> weapon that can be used to <strong>regain 4 sanity</strong>. The attacking speed is fast, but it can only hit a single target at a time. <strong>Damage drops off as your sanity increases.</strong> Use this when you are really low on sanity!</p>

  <h3>Shauntgun</h3>
  <img src="Shauntgun.png" alt="Shauntgun">
  <ul>
    <li>Hotkey: <strong>1</strong></li>
    <li>Sanity Usage: 2%</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 900</li>
    <li>Weapon Ready Time: 250 ms</li>
    <li>Weapon Fire Rate: 54.55 RPM (0.90 RPS)</li>
    <li>Base DPS: 810</li>
    <li>Range: Short</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A beautiful shotgun given to Shanvanth by Joshua. This thing is a calculus-slaying beast! This weapon is a <strong>short-ranged</strong>, <strong>single-shot</strong> weapon that uses <strong>hitscan</strong> to attack. This <strong>medium damage</strong> weapon is a good all-rounder up close, handling multiple enemies at once with <strong>piercing shots</strong>. It's versatile, but should not be used beyond <strong>close to medium range</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Shauniper</h3>
  <img src="Shauniper.png" alt="Shauniper">
  <ul>
    <li>Hotkey: <strong>2</strong></li>
    <li>Sanity Usage: 4%</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 1050</li>
    <li>Weapon Ready Time: 83 ms</li>
    <li>Weapon Fire Rate: 40 RPM (0.67 RPS)</li>
    <li>Base DPS: 700</li>
    <li>Range: Very Long</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Shan-inator 72, also known as the Shauniper, is a powerful old rifle designed by Shanvanth himself! This thing is powered by a TI-84 Plus, and can blow off integration problems from a mile away. This weapon is a <strong>long-ranged</strong> weapon that uses <strong>projectiles</strong> to attack. This projectile is <strong>100% accurate</strong>. This <strong>high-damage</strong> weapon is excellent for picking off enemies across the map, and has the <strong>highest single-shot damage</strong>. However, it is <strong>very slow</strong> with the <strong>lowest DPS in the game</strong>, and <strong>consumes a lot of sanity</strong> per shot. It only hits <strong>one target</strong>. Due to its low ready time, it is a great switch-in weapon for combos and a <strong>good utility</strong> choice in general.</p>

  <h3>Asshaunt Rifle</h3>
  <img src="ShanAssaultRifle.png" alt="Asshaunt Rifle">
  <ul>
    <li>Hotkey: <strong>3</strong></li>
    <li>Sanity Usage: 1%</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 300</li>
    <li>Weapon Ready Time: 500 ms</li>
    <li>Weapon Fire Rate: 900 RPM (15 RPS)</li>
    <li>Base DPS: 4500</li>
    <li>Range: Very Long</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A heavy, problem-slaying rifle with a dream to crush calculus. Shanvanth's assault rifle is great at shredding defenses. This weapon is a <strong>long-ranged</strong> weapon that uses <strong>projectiles</strong> to attack. This <strong>low-damage</strong> weapon makes up for its pathetic single-shot damage with an <strong>extremely fast fire rate</strong>, giving it a <strong>massive DPS</strong> that can shred enemies quickly. However, it has an <strong>8° spread</strong>, making it <strong>inaccurate at longer ranges</strong>. It also <strong>chews through sanity fast</strong>, making it inefficient as a main weapon. It only hits <strong>one target</strong>. It also has the <strong>slowest ready time</strong> in the game. For these reasons, it’s best used as a <strong>medium-ranged destroyer</strong> for <strong>tanky enemies</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Enemies</h2>

  <p><em>All stats assume you are in "Derivatives are doable..." difficulty, the normal difficulty, at level 1 with 50% sanity.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>HP:</strong> Base health points of the enemy.</li>
    <li><strong>Base Damage:</strong> The damage the enemy deals per hit.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Movement speed in pixels per second (PPS).</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> A rough idea of their attack range.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dominic</h3>
  <img src="Dom.png" alt="Dominic">
  <ul>
    <li>HP: 350</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 4</li>
    <li>Speed: 120 PPS</li>
    <li>Range: Melee</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Me! Dominic chases Shanvanth around relentlessly, harassing him and never letting him get away with his vicious speed. Dominic is <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>spawns very often</strong>, dealing <strong>low melee damage</strong>, but has relatively <strong>low health</strong> and can be killed easily with all weapons. He can easily <strong>swarm</strong> you, so get rid of them as fast as you can!</p>

  <h3>Cheng Feng</h3>
  <img src="Cheng.png" alt="Cheng Feng">
  <ul>
    <li>HP: 250</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 5</li>
    <li>Speed: 140 PPS</li>
    <li>Range: 170 px</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cheng Feng seeks to remind Shanvanth of his failures by hurling burnt tires at him. Cheng Feng is <strong>very fast</strong> and <strong>spawns often</strong>, usually supporting enemies in front of him. He deals <strong>moderate ranged damage</strong> and can attack up close as well. It's best not to leave him at <strong>medium range</strong> — pick him off either up close or from far away. He has <strong>very low health</strong>, making him a perfect victim for the M. Pencil.</p>

  <h3>Zuk</h3>
  <img src="Zuk.png" alt="Zuk">
  <ul>
    <li>HP: 700</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 6</li>
    <li>Speed: 30 PPS</li>
    <li>Range: Melee</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Zuk wants to slam down on Shanvanth and tell him to shut up about calculus by any means necessary. Zuk is a <strong>slow</strong> enemy that <strong>spawns sometimes</strong>, usually approaching slowly to pressure Shanvanth until he falls. He has <strong>lots of health</strong>, capable of eating shotgun blasts as waves progress, and deals <strong>moderate melee damage</strong>. Keep your distance and don’t let him get too close. Use combos to eliminate him quickly.</p>

  <h3>Shower</h3>
  <img src="Shower.jpg" alt="Shower">
  <ul>
    <li>HP: 3000</li>
    <li>Base Damage: 16</li>
    <li>Speed: 8 PPS</li>
    <li>Range: Melee</li>
  </ul>
